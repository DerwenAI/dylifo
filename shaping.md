In one text paragraph summarize the relationships among individuals.

Ignore the `match_level` values.

Describe which features among the `match_key` values from which specific datasets connect them.

Describe the `match_key` values, instead of referencing them directly, based on:

 `NAME` is the "name" of a person or organization
 `ADDRESS` is their "address"
 `DOB` is their "date of birth"
 `DRLIC` is their "driver's license number"
 `EMAIL` is their "email"
 `SURNAME` is their "surname"

For example, "Bob Jones and Mary Smith have an address in common from the CUSTOMERS dataset."

Make the entity names bold.

DO NOT suggest this interconnectedness is a network of relationships based on personal identifiers and attributes across the datasets.
DO NOT suggest this indicates a potential relationship between individuals based on shared identifiers across the datasets.
DO NOT suggest that entities share similar identifying information, or indicate a potential overlap in their profiles.
