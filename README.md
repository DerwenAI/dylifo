DSPy summary of Senzing ER results


## set up

This library uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for
package management, and first you need to install it. Then run:

```bash
poetry update
```

Also download/install `Ollama` <https://ollama.com/> and pull the
models you wish to use, for example:

```bash
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
```

Modify the `config.toml` configuration file to change models, adjust
parameters, etc.

If you're not running locally, be sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY`
environment variable.

For the interactive demo, you need to pull the latest Docker container
for Senzing:

```bash
docker pull senzing/serve-grpc:latest
```


## demo

Run the `demo.py` script with one of the JSON data files, for example:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo.py data/get.json
```

For an interactive UI based on [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/):
first launch this container and have it running in the background:

```bash
docker run -it --publish 8261:8261 --rm senzing/serve-grpc
```

Then run:

```bash
poetry run streamlit run stream.py data/get.json
```
