# dylifo

Streamlit demo using DSPy to summarize JSON from the Senzing SDK.


## Set Up

This library uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for
package management, and first you need to install it. Then run:

```bash
poetry update
```

Also download/install `Ollama` <https://ollama.com/> and pull the
models you wish to use, for example:

```bash
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
```

If you're not running locally, set the configuration parameter
`run_local` false and be sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable to your key.

Otherwise modify the `config.toml` configuration file to change
models, adjust parameters, etc.


To prepare for the interactive demo, first pull the latest Docker
container for Senzing:

```bash
docker pull senzing/serve-grpc:latest
```


## Run Demo

Run the `demo.py` script with one of the JSON data files, for example:

```bash
poetry run python3 demo.py data/get.json
```


For an interactive UI based on [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/):
first launch this container and have it running in the background:

```bash
docker run -it --publish 8261:8261 --rm senzing/serve-grpc
```

Then run:

```bash
poetry run streamlit run stream.py data/get.json
```

Restart the container each time before re-running the Streamlit demo.
